        <p>
          We may share the information that we collect, both personal and
          non-personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest
          sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide
          our content or whose products or services we think may interest you.
          We may also share it with our current and future affiliated companies
          and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale
          or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your
          personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform
          functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining
          our servers and the website, database storage and management, e-mail
          management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer
          service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may
          purchase through the website. We will likely share your personal
          information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these
          third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for
          you.

        <p>
          We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses,
          for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics
          partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address
          is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other
          technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the
          website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the
          website. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what
          you see on the website and then provide auditing, research and
          reporting for us and our advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you
          to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we,
          in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to
          respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our
          rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the
          public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or
