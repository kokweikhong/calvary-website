### All lumber carries responsibility, and we act through science-based solutions and responsible sourcing to secure a sustainable future

## With Singapore’s Green Plan aiming for 80% of buildings to be green and super low energy by 2030, the demand for sustainable materials, carbon savings, and green financing solutions is more urgent than ever.

As timber specialists and installers advocating for sustainable building, we recognise that we are living in a defining moment. Every decision we make from sourcing to installation, carries a responsibility to people and the planet. That’s why Calvary is taking science-based actions, advancing responsible sourcing such as timber transparency under ISO14064, and rethinking the role of timber in the built environment of Singapore's green future beyond 2030.

The Calvary Sustainability Report outlines our commitments and progress to date. It highlights the actions we’ve taken to lower our environmental footprint, champion safe and healthy materials, and support the communities we serve.

FOOTNOTE: Calvary Carpentry has been a proud member of the [Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC)](https://web.sgbc.online/public/memberdirectory/1243) since 2021. Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do at Calvary Carpentry. Our commitment drives us to continually innovate and improve our practices. We've moved beyond traditional hardwood materials to include more sustainable options

### Building Better Futures with Timber

Caring for people and places starts with how we design, source, and share knowledge:

- **Undergoing ISO 14064:** We have undergone rigorous timber auditing with our suppliers and logistics to better understand our GHG carbon emissions beyond our domestic emissions.
- **Sustainability Furniture Mark (SFM):** Our decking material and system have achieved the Singapore SFM, recognising our low-VOC, safe-for-home materials.
- **Education & Awareness:** We work with architects, designers, and homeowners to highlight the benefits of timber as a natural carbon store.
- **Community Engagement:** Through events like an educational sustainability workshop with the Singapore Institute of Management, we bring together industry partners to co-create solutions for healthier, more sustainable spaces.

---

### Expanding Sustainability Through Partnerships

- **Collaboration with [Nautilus Innovation (formerly Venturer)](https://nautilus-innovation.com):** In 2024, we partnered with Nautilus Innovation to champion **MET (Mass-Engineered Timber)**, a sustainable method of construction that further reduces the carbon footprint of the built environment. Their recent projects in the Maldives and Singapore are a testament to MET’s impact. The construction of Ritz-Carlton, Fari Islands, Maldives set a new standard for sustainable luxury hospitality; the project produced a Green Loan conversion valued at US $180 Million, and reduced 6,000 tonnes of Carbon from the construction process. In Singapore, they led the construction of the **Geneo Canopy**, the tallest MET canopy in the world. The structure stores 952 tonnes CO2e net biogenic carbon, which makes the entire project carbon negative.

### Designing for the Planet

We are committed to reducing impact across the full timber supply chain:

- **Science-Based Timber Choices:** We distribute and install products such as **Accoya Radiata Pine** _(Cradle to Cradle Certified)_, **Reconstituted Bamboo** _(FSC Certified, Class 0 Fire Resistant)_, and **Champaca Flooring** _(FSC Plantation Teak)_. These materials are engineered for high performance, meet the most rigorous accreditations, and are naturally sustainable, minimising environmental impact while helping to sequester total carbon emissions.
- **Circular Thinking:** With innovations like the **Ez-rail Decking Clip System**, we address the common industry challenges of maintenance and waste. The system provides a low-cost and easy-to-replace option that's perfect for harsh weather conditions. Compatible with dimensionally stable products such as OneWood _(FSC and SGBC Certified)_, **Accoya Radiata Pine and Calvary Composite.**
- **Responsible Sourcing:** We work closely with global partners to ensure each batch of timber is harvested and manufactured under responsible, verifiable standards.
- **Carbon Benefits:** Every cubic metre of timber we install stores carbon naturally, contributing to climate solutions while creating beautiful spaces. For each project, whether large-scale or bespoke, we ensure stability and performance, while supporting green certification, carbon savings, and even green financing goals.

### Bringing sustainable options to you

- **Bamboo – a Carbon Neutral building material:** In 2023, we introduced **Reconstituted Bamboo.** Bamboo grows a staggering 1 inch every one hour, making it an exceptional material for carbon sequestration. It is further engineered for durability, impregnated with fire resistance (Class 0).
- **Accoya Projects with Impact:** We have since completed several large-scale **Accoya** installations — including **Banyan Mandai Rainforest** _(Singapore’s Super Low Energy Resort)_ and **Artyzen Hotel** — showcasing how modified timber can lower embodied carbon while delivering long-lasting performance in tropical environments.

---

### Looking Ahead

Calvary’s mission is clear: to make timber not just a material of choice, but a solution for climate resilience. From carbon-neutral bamboo to science-backed modified timber and pioneering partnerships, we continue to drive progress toward a low-carbon, sustainable future for buildings and communities.

**We invite our partners, clients, and industry peers to join us in creating sustainable spaces — one project at a time.**

Cheers, The Calvary Carpentry Team
