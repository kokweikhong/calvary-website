## 1. Wood Decking

#### Pros:

- Certain wood species, like Indian rosewood, carry a luxurious appeal. It is highly sought after and recognized by any wood lover, adding intrinsic value to your space.
- Natural wood disperses heat rapidly, offering a comfortable touch underfoot.
- Easily rejuvenated. Through sanding and varnishing, you have the flexibility to refresh the appearance of your timber surface. Should you grow weary of a particular stain, a simple process of removing a layer of timber allows for the application of a new colour, restoring its aesthetic appeal to a pristine state.

#### Cons:

- Regular annual maintenance is imperative, even with high-quality sealants and varnishes, due to the organic nature of timber.
- Its protective varnish layer fades over time, exposing wood to UV damage, discoloration, cracks, warpage, and splinters.

## 2. Composite Decking

#### Pros:

- If installed correctly, a well-made composite deck can last a lifetime, and Calvary Composite Decking offers a 10-year warranty.
- Uniform in appearance, composite decks offer a modern aesthetic.
- Priced at a comparable level to mid-tier timber products.

#### Cons:

- Visually distinguishable from natural timber decks.
- In the event of any man-made damage to the decks, regrettably, the only recourse is to replace the affected piece.
- On hot days, composite decks can become uncomfortably hot, requiring precautions like wearing slippers to avoid blisters.

## 3. Fused Decking

Addressing heating issues, MOSO bamboo decking contains 87% moso bamboo fibers, reducing heat retention compared to composite decks. Offering a 25-year warranty, MOSO N-durance Decking achieves the highest fire retardancy (Bfl- s1, EN 13501-1), enhancing durability, fungal, and termite resistance. Like all deckings, the protective coating fades over time, leaving the timber susceptible to UV exposure and silvering. Our OSMO coating effectively revitalizes decking colors, addressing this issue.
