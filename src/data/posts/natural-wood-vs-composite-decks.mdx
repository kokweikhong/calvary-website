## 1. Wood Decking

#### Pros:

- Certain wood species, like Indian rosewood, carry a luxurious appeal. It is highly sought after and recognized by any wood lover, adding intrinsic value to your space.
- Natural wood disperses heat rapidly, offering a comfortable touch underfoot.
- Easily rejuvenated. Through sanding and varnishing, you have the flexibility to refresh the appearance of your timber surface. Should you grow weary of a particular stain, a simple process of removing a layer of timber allows for the application of a new colour, restoring its aesthetic appeal to a pristine state.

#### Cons:

- Regular annual maintenance is imperative, even with high-quality sealants and varnishes, due to the organic nature of timber.
- Its protective varnish layer fades over time, exposing wood to UV damage, discoloration, cracks, warpage, and splinters.

## 2. Composite Decking
